Please review, upgrade, and optimize the entire system to make it fully modern, professional, and optimized — both in design (visual) and functionality (monitoring).  

Important: Do a full evaluation of the system and identify improvements that can be implemented to make it more modern, professional, and useful for real network monitoring activities. Apply those improvements directly.

Requirements:
1. Core functionality (must keep working):
   - Machines must load automatically from machines.csv
   - Real-time monitoring of online/offline status
   - Display "Last Time Online" for offline machines
   - Summary counters (total, online, offline, average latency)
   - Export to PDF instead of CSV

2. Dashboard design (visual modernization):
   - Make the interface as modern and professional as possible.
   - Clean UI with professional typography, modern layout, and responsive design.
   - Clear visual indicators for machine status (colors, icons, badges).
   - Subtle animations for status updates.
   - Manual **light/dark mode** switch.
   - Sticky header with the title **"Sistemas Olivium"**.
   - Professional footer with dynamic year and:
     "© <year> Sistemas Olivium - Todos os direitos reservados".
   - Header and footer must adapt to both light and dark modes.

3. Monitoring optimization (functional improvements):
   - Optimize backend for performance and scalability (use async/threading).
   - Ensure efficient monitoring even with dozens of machines.
   - Improve detection accuracy and reliability.
   - Optimize refresh/data handling for real-time performance.

4. New features and improvements (evaluation required):
   - Analyze the system and implement extra features that make sense for real professional monitoring.  
     Examples (only if useful):
       - Average response time / latency display
       - Uptime history tracking
       - Alerts if a machine stays offline too long
       - Filters or search bar in the dashboard
       - Export options for logs or history
   - You decide the best enhancements, based on what will make the system more modern and practical.

5. PDF Export:
   - Export all fields (name, IP, status, last time online, latency, etc.).
   - Include the same **header ("Sistemas Olivium")** and **footer** from the dashboard.
   - Style must match the modern design of the dashboard.

6. Documentation:
   - Provide a complete **README.md** in Portuguese (pt-BR) only.
   - Explain installation, configuration, usage, features, PDF export, light/dark mode.
   - If you add new features, include them in the documentation.
   - Keep it clear for non-technical users.

7. Testing:
   - Ensure all machines appear on startup.
   - Verify monitoring is stable, accurate, and efficient.
   - Dashboard counters must match actual machine statuses.
   - PDF export must include header/footer.
   - Light/Dark mode must work.
   - Header and footer must render correctly.
   - Test all new improvements you implement.

Goal:
Deliver a **fully modern, professional, and optimized network monitoring dashboard**, improving both **design** and **monitoring functionality**, and adding any useful new features you identify, keeping everything in Portuguese (pt-BR), fully tested and ready for production.
